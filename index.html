They became popular in Southern gospel during the 1950s. Their name was changed to the Oak Ridge Boys in the early 1960s, and they remained a gospel group until the mid-1970s, when they changed their image and concentrated on country music.

                        Itâ€™s difficult to know how to assess the impact of a thoroughly dubious character such as Kanye West voicing harsh but truthful statements about war, disaster and media bias. The hip-hop music genre has been rightfully criticized for glorifying violence, misogyny and hedonism. Yet here is an artist who, while by no means a political leader or a role model, can still reach a very large and impressionable audience.
