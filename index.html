                        It’s difficult to know how to assess the impact of a thoroughly dubious character such as Kanye West voicing harsh but truthful statements about war, disaster and media bias. The hip-hop music genre has been rightfully criticized for glorifying violence, misogyny and hedonism. Yet here is an artist who, while by no means a political leader or a role model, can still reach a very large and impressionable audience.
